					In our perspective, religious tolerance has something to do with us people for we created 
					it. Created in such a way that we judge other people's belief and comment unecessary things
					without even reflection on our own. So for us to be respected, we must also respect theirs no
					matter what for we are all a child of God.

					<strong>James 1:26-27</strong><br>
					<p>If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this 
					person's religion is worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is 
					this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
					</p>
					
					<strong>Luke 9:46-47</strong><br>
					<p>An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest. But Jesus, knowing what 
					they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side.</p>
					
					<strong>2 Peter 2:1</strong><br>
					<p>But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, 
					who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing 
					swift destruction upon themselves.</p>
					
					<strong>John 3:16 </strong><br>
					<p>â€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</p>
